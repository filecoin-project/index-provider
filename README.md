> A reference implementation of index data provider

This repo provides a reference data provider implementation that can be used to advertise content to
indexer nodes and serve retreival requests over graphsync.

## Current status :construction:

This implementation is under active development.

## Install

Prerequisite:

- [Go 1.16+](https://golang.org/doc/install)

To use the provider as a Go library, execute:

```shell
go get github.com/filecoin-project/index-provider
```

To install the latest runnable version of the provider service, execute:

```shell
go install github.com/filecoin-project/index-provider/cmd/provider@latest
```

## Storage usage

The index provider [engine](engine/engine.go) uses a given datastore to persist two general category of data:
1. Internal advertisement mappings, and
2. Chunked entries chain cache

If the datastore passed to the engine is reused, it is recommended to wrap it in a namespace prior 
to instantiating the engine.

### Internal advertisement mappings
The internal advertisement mappings are purely used by the engine to efficiently handle publication 
requests. It generally includes:
- mapping to the latest advertisement
- mappings between advertisement CIDs, their context ID and their corresponding metadata.

The storage consumed by such mappings is negligible and grows linearly as a factor of the number of 
advertisements published.

### Chunked entries chain cache
This category stores chunked entries generated by publishing an advertisement with a never seen 
before context ID. The chunks are stored in an LRU cache, the maximum size of which is configured by
the following configuration parameters in [`Ingest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/filecoin-project/index-provider@v0.2.6/config#Ingest) config:
- `LinkChunkSize` - The maximum number of multihashes in a chunk (defaults to `16,384`)
- [`LinkCacheSize`] - The maximum number of entries links to chace (defaults to `1024`)

The exact storage usage depends on the size of multihashes. For example, using the default config 
to advertise 128-bit long multihashes will result in chunk sizes of 0.25MiB with maximum cache 
growth of 256 MiB. 

To delete the cache set `PurgeLinkCache` to `true` and restart the engine.

Note that the LRU cache may grow beyond its max size if the generated chain of chunks is longer than
the configured `LinkChunkSize`. This is to avoid partial caching of chunks within a single 
advertisement. The cache expansion is logged in `INFO` level at `provider/engine` logging subsystem.

## Running Provider Service

To run a provider service it must first be initialized. To initialize the provider, execute:

```shell
provider init
```

Initialization generates a default configuration for the provider instance along with a randomly
generated identity keypair. The configuration is stored at user home
under `.index-provider/config` in JSON format. The root configuration path can be overridden by
setting the `PROVIDER_PATH` environment variable

Once initialized, start the service daemon by executing:

```shell
provider daemon
```

The running daemon allows advertisement of new content to the indexer nodes and retrieval of content
over graphsync. Additionally, it starts an admin HTTP server that enables administrative operations
using the `provider` CLI tool. By default, the admin server is bound to `http://localhost:3102`.

## `provider` CLI

The `provider` CLI can be used to interact with a running daemon via the admin server to perform a
range of administrative operations. For example, the `provider` CLI can be used to import a CAR file
and advertise its content to the indexer nodes by executing:

```shell
provider import car -l http://localhost:3102 -i <path-to-car-file>
```

For full usage, execute `provider`. Usage:
